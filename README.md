# Qatium assessment - Child care app

This is a simple web aplication that allows child care management related to a child-care community:

User stories:

* As a User, I want to access the group of parents to see the list of child-care requests fulfilled with the following information:
    * Requester
    * Child Care Worker
    * Date and time of the request
    * Duration
    * Description / Notes
    * The list should be ordered by the last starting date.
* AsaUser,I want to add a new User to the app.
* As a User, I want to add a new child-care request.
    * A request is always completed and there is no need to be accepted. In fact, a request represents what already happened with its duration and details.
* As a User, I want to see the hours balance of the child-care userâ€™s community.
* As a User, I want to calculate the minimum number of child-care requests that have to be fulfilled to net the time debts.
